# Authentication and Billing Flow Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to implement the new authentication flow with billing page redirection and login persistence.

## Changes Made

### 1. Account Creation Flow
- **Before**: Users were redirected to checkout page after signup
- **After**: Users are now redirected to a dedicated billing page (`/billing`) after successful account creation
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/auth/Signup.jsx`

### 2. Login Persistence ("Remember Me")
- **Feature**: Users can now check "Remember me" to save their email for future logins
- **Implementation**: 
  - Email is stored in localStorage when "Remember me" is checked
  - Email is automatically filled in on subsequent visits
  - Credentials are cleared when "Remember me" is unchecked
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/auth/Login.jsx`

### 3. Authentication State Management
- **New Context**: Created `AuthContext` to manage authentication state globally
- **Features**:
  - Centralized authentication state
  - Automatic token validation on app load
  - Global login/logout functions
- **Files Created**: `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`

### 4. Header Navigation Updates
- **Dynamic Menu**: Header now shows different options based on authentication status
- **Authenticated Users**: See Profile and Logout options
- **Unauthenticated Users**: See Login and Sign Up options
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/common/header/Header.jsx`

### 5. Protected Routes
- **New Component**: `ProtectedRoute` component to secure pages
- **Protected Pages**: Billing and Profile pages now require authentication
- **Files Created**: `src/components/common/ProtectedRoute.jsx`

### 6. Billing Page
- **New Component**: Dedicated billing page for new account setup
- **Features**:
  - Pre-filled with user information from signup
  - Comprehensive billing form with address and payment details
  - Integration with backend API
  - Option to skip and complete later
- **Files Created**: `src/components/Billing.jsx`

### 7. Backend API Enhancement
- **New Endpoint**: `/api/user/billing` for saving billing information
- **Features**:
  - Saves billing address to database
  - Updates user information
  - Requires authentication token
- **Files Modified**: `backend/server.js`

## User Flow

### New User Registration
1. User fills out signup form
2. Account is created successfully
3. User is automatically logged in
4. User is redirected to billing page
5. User can complete billing setup or skip for later
6. After billing setup, user is redirected to home page

### Returning User Login
1. User visits login page
2. If "Remember me" was previously checked, email is pre-filled
3. User enters password and optionally checks "Remember me"
4. User is logged in and redirected to checkout/home page
5. Header shows Profile and Logout options

### Authentication State
- Authentication state is maintained across page refreshes
- Protected pages automatically redirect to login if not authenticated
- Logout clears all stored credentials and authentication state

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Context
```javascript
const { user, isAuthenticated, loading, login, logout } = useAuth();
```

### Protected Route Usage
```javascript
<Route path="/billing" element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
        <Billing />
    </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### Remember Me Implementation
```javascript
// Store credentials
if (rememberMe) {
    localStorage.setItem('rememberedEmail', formData.email);
    localStorage.setItem('rememberMe', 'true');
}

// Load credentials on component mount
useEffect(() => {
    const rememberedEmail = localStorage.getItem('rememberedEmail');
    const rememberMeStatus = localStorage.getItem('rememberMe');
    
    if (rememberedEmail && rememberMeStatus === 'true') {
        setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, email: rememberedEmail }));
        setRememberMe(true);
    }
}, []);
```

## Security Considerations
- JWT tokens are used for authentication
- Protected routes prevent unauthorized access
- Credentials are only stored locally when explicitly requested
- All sensitive operations require valid authentication tokens

## Future Enhancements
- Password reset functionality
- Email verification
- Social login integration
- Enhanced payment method management
- Address book functionality
